<h1>Report: Large Coursework</h1>
<h2>David Costa Cardoso</h2>
<br>
<a href="http://igor.gold.ac.uk/~dcard001/website">Live IGOR version</a><br><br>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">This website is about an ONG that I founded with friends in 2010. This website presents the ONG, it’s objectives, the past and future events and how to be part of it. </p>
<br>
<h2>Background:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">My audience is junior and senior public engaged in local volunteering. Relevant stakeholders such as local professionals interested in sharing knowledge are referred in the website. 
My inspiration for this website was based on the original Eleva-te# website created in 2011 and by a artist friend called Cláudio Santos that helped us to build Eleva-te# image. I have adopted his style on posters throughout the existence of the ONG and that is also reflected in the chosen layout and colour scheme. Althought I feel that the website can be improved, I know that it fullfills the expectations of the target public.</p>
<br>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">I have chosen to implement a minimalistic structure where information is presented in a clear and clean way and the colour scheme highlights the important parts, so the user has a experience easy to the eyes and mind.<br>
Additionally, I considered accessibility for my website. My HTML code is as semantic as possible hence easy to understand for screen readers. By using semantic HTML code such as <i>button</i>, <i>form</i> and <i>article</i> I have clearly defined the content. Moreover, I have planned the use of heading tags, defining its importance by using the according tag. Furthermore, every image on my website has alt attribute, which provide an alternate text for the image in case that the user can not view it for different reasons. I have also declared the language and chose the colour scheme with colour blindness in mind. Through my research I have found that the most common colour blindness is deuteranomaly which is reduced sensitivity to green light. </p>
<br>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">While creating the website I have research and learned a huge number of things. The main three things I have researched where:<br>
-	When use a fixed navigation bar;<br>
-	How to use media queries to optimise the print of a webpage;<br>
-	How use iframe to embed a live calendar and a usable map.
<br>
Regarding the best setting for using a fixed navigation bar, I have researched different pages that provided me with different opinions. Ultimately, I end up deciding that the best use of such navigation bar would be in a responsive setting to be applied in screens the size of tables.<br>

The print media queries were something entirely new to me, but I have to admit that now I realised that most of it is achieved by only acknowledging what is relevant or not to be printed. Overall, most of the code is disabling proprieties of specific elements or even hide them so won’t be printed.[1]<br>

A great resource that I have used is a hover library created by Ian Lunn. I have used it before in another project and I have used again for being so complete. I used the code in the library and modified accordingly to meet my design objectives. [2]</p><br>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">Creating this website was a good challenge and a great way to test and apply knowledge obtain in labs. From everything coded, I want to point three things that I’m very pleased with the result: responsiveness, colour scheme and user interaction.<br>
I strongly believe that this website is full responsive to different screens, makes good use of the colour scheme to engage the user and provides a good user experience due to the presence of interaction elements.<br>

Albeit these three aspects working fairly well in my opinion, there are other areas where I feel that the website could be improved. The footer could be more useful through the use of a site map, breadcrumbs would be a good navigation addiction and the contact form could have a more appealing look. These issues can be fixed by researching more about theses features and the its best usability.</p><br>
