					<h1 class="page-title">Our activities</h1>
					<p> The best way to achieve our goal, to restore the sense of community in Quinta do Conde's population through shared knowledge, is to bring together different people with a common interest. And nothing better than an innovative and interesting activity to bond between two strangers.
					With this idea in mind, since the foundation of Eleva-te Associação Cívico-cultural we have promoted dozens of activities on different themes, for different age groups in the community.<br><br>
					We intend to promote activities of relevance to the community and impacting on the improvement of each one's life. Using volunteers with professional experience in various sectors, we have carried out actions in diverse areas such as interculturality, health and well-being, sports, personal promotion, first aid, dance, environment and conservation, child hygiene and many others.
					As a participant you can join the many volunteers and streamline an activity within your area (professional or not). <br><br>
					The community thanks you for your knowledge sharing and you gain proven experience beyond all the benefits of volunteering.</p>
