					<h2 class="page-title">Hi there!</h2>
					<p>We are Eleva-te Associação Cívico-cultural, a Portuguese young non-profit association of Quinta do Conde created
					on October 1st, 2010 with the aim of restoring a sense of community among the inhabitants of our village, through
					sharing personal knowledge, from voluntary actions promoted to and from the population.<br>
					Welcome to our website. Here you can find out all about Eleva-te#: who we are, what we want, how we do it and how
					you can participate and/or help us.</p><a href="img/vertical.logo.jpg"><img alt="Eleva-te# vertical logo version" src="img/vertical.logo.jpg"></a></div>

					<h2 class="page-title">The beginning</h2><img alt="Eleva-te# first photo after the group brainstorm" src=
					"img/about-us.beggining.png">
					<p>Hot summer nights were the days when it all began. One night we decided that we no longer wanted to sit down to
					talk badly. Something has unleashed a fighting spirit, a desire to change something, to take action and plan
					something bigger for our planet! Among this group of friends, ideas began to come up one after another and in no
					time, we would meet weekly in the local park, Parque da Vila, for our snacks with natural juices.<br>
					Well, such was the planning that a few weeks later the thing was starting to take shape and on October 1st 2010,
					the dream comes true and Eleva-te Associação Cívico-cultural is born.<br>
					A new ONG was born, whose main objective is to share knowledge, experiences and personal experiences, thus seeking
					to promote a greater and better sense of community among the inhabitants of Quinta do Conde village, through the
					promotion of the most varied types of volunteer actions, from and for the population, such as workshops,
					exhibitions, training, among many other ways.</p>
